# Scheduling-Biobjective-Qm-skj-dj-aj-Ui

This project aims to solve the uniform parallel machine scheduling problem with time windows, set-up times, unreachable job constraints, and minimizing earliness, tardiness, and total distance. This was my dissertation to obtain the title of MSc in Industrial Engineering at Los Andes University.

The document, the models and instances are included here.

Abstract:
Three solution methods are proposed for the unaddressed uniform parallel machine scheduling problem with time windows, set-up times, and unreachable job constraints. The concept of unreachable jobs is a rethinking of the Machine Availability Constraints, where a set of available machines is defined for each job. In contrast, Unreachable Job Constraints establish a set of jobs that each machine cannot perform. This new approach reduces the number of sets required as input when the set of jobs is significant. The problem consists of minimizing the number of days a job is performed out of its time window and simultaneously the time taken to travel the total distance required by the solution. An exact method and two heuristic approaches are discussed.
